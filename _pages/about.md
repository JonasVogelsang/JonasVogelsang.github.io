I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the VISUS (Visualisierungsinstitut der Universit√§t Stuttgart), specializing in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), Augmented Reality (AR), and Situated Visualization. I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Stuttgart, providing a solid foundation for my current research interests.

My work revolves around the practical intersections of HRI, AR, and Situated Visualization. Based at VISUS, I'm focused on contributing insights to these evolving technologies. Let's explore the potential of these fields together in shaping a tech-driven future.
